We have successfully implemented logic using the Facebook Marketing API (Graph API) to find this information for many ads, likely by querying the ad_creative associated with the ad and inspecting fields like object_story_spec, effective_object_story_id, or related attachments. However, we are facing difficulties when an ad originates from an existing organic page post (e.g., a boosted post or a dark post created from an organic video post). In these specific cases, our current methods fail to reliably extract the underlying Video ID or its permalink URL from the ad or creative object. The necessary information seems to be nested differently or requires traversing different API relationships. What We Need: We are looking for an experienced Facebook Marketing API developer/consultant to: Investigate: Analyze the Facebook Marketing API structure and relationships between Ads, Ad Creatives, Page Posts, and Video objects, specifically focusing on the scenario where ads are derived from existing organic posts. Develop a Solution: Determine the correct sequence of API calls, required fields, and logic to consistently and reliably retrieve the Video ID or Video Permalink URL, given an Ad ID, for all types of video ads, including those based on organic posts. Deliver: Provide clear, actionable deliverables, which could be one or both of the following: A Detailed Explanation: A well-documented explanation of the necessary API endpoints, parameters, fields to query, required permissions, and the logic/flow to follow. Include potential edge cases and how to handle them. Required Skills & Experience: Deep Expertise: Proven, hands-on experience with the Facebook Marketing API (Graph API). API Object Knowledge: Strong understanding of Facebook API objects, including Ads (/ads), Ad Creatives (/adcreatives), Page Posts (/posts), and Videos (/videos), and their relationships. Troubleshooting: Demonstrated ability to debug API calls, analyze JSON responses, and navigate complex data structures to find specific information. Problem Solving: Ability to understand the specific challenge related to organic post-based ads and devise a robust solution. Clear Communication: Ability to clearly explain technical solutions and API logic. Nice-to-Have Skills: Experience specifically retrieving video metadata via the API. Familiarity with different ad formats (e.g., single video, carousel with video). Experience working with Facebook Business Manager and Ads Manager. Experience developing applications or scripts that interact heavily with the Facebook API. What We Will Provide: Sample Ad IDs (examples of where our current method works and where it fails, specifically the organic post cases). Details about our current (failing) approach/API calls. Access to relevant Facebook API documentation links we've consulted. Willingness to grant temporary, scoped API access if necessary and securely feasible, or guidance on making specific test calls from our end based on your instructions.

This tool should also be capable of constructing a knowledge graph that incorporates website links and relevant topics according to my input. all content should be able to be summurized from the one hand, from the other hand i should be able to query the knowledge base/graph and get answers. sometimes these answers have to rely on searching other resources online like articles and videos and extracting relevant information . The ideal candidate will have experience in AI, natural language processing, machine learning, and graph databases to ensure the functionality and efficiency of the tool. the application should be able to run on a local computer without resorting to too much computational resource (ollama would be an option). The other option is to make use of Apis, once the model is trained, as long as it is not very costly (price of use has to be discussed) -i should also be able to set a workflow that tries to extract new information/links from crawling the web everyday and summurize the findings ect...exactly like described earlier, the only additional thing is that the process is automated everyday (example if i am trying to get AI updates everyday on my app, or just general news about a certain topic) I recorded a brief video related to the project showing how this can be implemented using make or n8n. https://www.loom.com/share/3a19a56894e143cbbcae61b97f9e3b3a 1-We NEED to handle the knowedge graph and build relationships among topics and subtopics. 2- on my desktop i should be able to have access to a main dashboard (just like obsidian for example). it can look like chatgpt but with menus like obisidan and dashboard like we woud discuss the idea is to be able to input websites, youtube channels and podcast playlists, the program should be able to crawl and transcript everything, create a knowledge graph, summaries and i should be able to query that knowledge graphs/set of articles / summaries. the system should also be able to create an article based on a prompt. (based on the amount of data extracted/transcribed) the approach I would take relating to the knowledge graph is where a local AI model is used (Mistral via Ollama) to automatically extract topics and relationships from the transcripts. (use of APis can be discussed) The system then builds an interactive graph using D3.js, where you can visually explore connections — zoom, drag, hover for labels — all from within the desktop app. You add a podcast, YouTube link, or document, and the graph is generated automatically alongside summaries, searchable Q&A, and even article creation from prompts. Future additional features to have (we should make sure we can reuse the code): -it should work as a plugin to chrome for example. -it can work as a mobile app, all i have to do is to share the list of links/youtube/pdf repository ect to the app (i should be able to have different folders in app to be able to handle different topics)"

We fine-tuned an in-house porn detection model based on EfficientNet and TensorFlow. We have our own in-house dataset for training, and our own jupyter notebooks (kinda messy) that we've been using. Now we need to modernize! Switch to PyTorch. Clean up the code. Select more modern models (probably RepViT for our first pass and and FastViT for our second pass). And above all, improve the misclassification rate. False positives are VERY BAD for us. https://chatgpt.com/share/68095bcb-32e4-8013-9a22-9278eee39935 What Winning Looks Like: Within 1 month, have migrated our Tensorflow training system over to PyTorch with the newer models mentioned above. It should run inference at least 2x faster than our old EfficientNetV2 models, and the false positives rate should be improved as well."

Unzip the file to retrieve approximately 10,000 HTML files containing companies' annual reports. Step 2: File Filtering & Selection 1. Retain only files larger than 100KB (as smaller files are likely irrelevant or contain minimal data). 2. Identify relevant files containing sustainability information. Currently, this is done manually by searching for keywords such as: ○ ""carbon"" ○ ""carbon footprint"" ○ ""SECR report"" ○ ""sustainability"" 3. Develop an automated filtering mechanism to identify relevant files based on predefined keywords and NLP techniques. 4. Delete irrelevant files, reducing the dataset to around 500-1,000 files.
